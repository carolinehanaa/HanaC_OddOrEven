Odd or even, the console will display if the number is even or odd
Peer Review by Carlos Felipe - This program works great. It takes in any number and tells me if it's odd or even. The code is formatted and named correctly. 

Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.

https://localhost:7044/oddoreven/oddoreven/{number}
